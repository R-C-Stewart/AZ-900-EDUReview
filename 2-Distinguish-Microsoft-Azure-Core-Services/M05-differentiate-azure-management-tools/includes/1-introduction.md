## Introduction

**Course Description**

Once you start deploying your infrastructure and solution to the cloud, you will want tools to help you organize and manage them.  Being able to deploy new systems quickly and see if they are functioning optimally give you a competitive advantage.

At Contoso, you come from a long background of using scipts to deploy your systems and application on-premises.  I am sure you are wondering if you have similar capabilities in the cloud.  The need to deploy several similarlly configured servers at the same time, then deploy your application is a must. Also, since the servers are in the cloud versus in your datacenter, how cna you tell they are running once they are deployed.  Tools like PowerShell, resource templates, and Azure Advisor can help with the job.
     
In this module you will learn about the available tools to help you deploy and manage your cloud deployment.  Then you will experiment with using each of those tools to deploy a server to the cloud, and verify it is functioning.

By the end of this module, you will be able to explain what management tools are available in Azure and what they are used for.
