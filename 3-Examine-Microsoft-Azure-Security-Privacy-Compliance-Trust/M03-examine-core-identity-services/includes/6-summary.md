## Summary

Identity allows us to maintain a security perimeter, even outside our physical control. With single sign-on and appropriate role-based access configuration, we can always be sure who is able to see and manipulate our data and infrastructure.

In this module, you learned about:

+ Authentication versus authorization
+ Azure Active Directory
+ Azure Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

There's a lot more to learn about Identity in Azure, but what you learned in this module gives you a solid foundation for the Azure Fundamentals.
