## Introduction

Azure will let you build out any solution that you can think up, from mobile applications, to games running in the cloud, to ecommerces systems, and many others.  With those sites you will need tools to support you in keeping them secure, and your data protected.

> At Contoso shipping you are just getting started with some virtual machines and a web application to support your drone delivery system and delivery drivers.  You do have customer information stored in the system that you will need to keep safe.  You will want to make sure all your systems meet a minimum level of security, your communication certificates are protected, and information is protected from attacks.

There are many tools in Azure to help you support your company security needs.  From tools to assess your current security stance and vulnerabilities to tools that can help you store and encrypt your secrets, data, and documents.  In this module we will look at those tools, when and why you would use them, and what they can do.

By the end of this module you will understand what tools Azure provides to both evaluate and help to protect your solutions running in the cloud.
