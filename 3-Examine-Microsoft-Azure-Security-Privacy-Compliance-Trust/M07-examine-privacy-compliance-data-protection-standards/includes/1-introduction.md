## Introduction

Governing your own resources and how they are used is only part of the solution when using a cloud provider. You also have to understand how the provider manages the underlying resources you are building on.

Microsoft takes this management seriously and provides full transparency with four sources:

+ Microsoft Privacy Statement
+ Microsoft Trust Center
+ Service Trust Portal
+ Compliance Manager

In this module, you will review about Microsoft Privacy statement and learn about the tools we provide to you to build trust and compliance into your solutions running in the cloud.

In this module, you will:

+ List compliance terms and requirements
+ Review the Microsoft Privacy Statement
+ Explore the Trust Center, Compliance Manager, and Service Trust Portal
