## Application Security groups

[Application security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#application-security-groups?azure-portal=true) enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups.

This feature allows you to reuse your security policy at scale without manual maintenance of explicit IP addresses. The platform handles the complexity of explicit IP addresses and multiple rule sets, allowing you to focus on your business logic.

## Example

An ASG enables you to group servers with similar port filtering requirements, and group together servers with similar functions, such as web servers. In the below example, we have ASGs defined for Web Servers, App Servers, and DB Servers and green and red arrows indicating which network traffic paths are allowable and which are not.

In the below example, multiple applications are deployed into the same virtual network. Based on the security rules described, workloads are isolated from each other. If a VM from one of the applications is compromised, lateral exploration is limited, minimizing the potential impact of an attacker. In this example, letâ€™s assume one of the web server VMs from application1 is compromised, the rest of the application will continue to be protected, even access to critical workloads like database servers will still be unreachable. This implementation provides multiple extra layers of security to your network, making this intrusion less harmful and easy to react on such events.

ASGs help simplify how you can filter and control network traffic coming into your organization and how that network traffic is allowed to move. They allow you to isolate multiple workloads and provide additional levels of protection for your virtual network in a more easily manageable way.
