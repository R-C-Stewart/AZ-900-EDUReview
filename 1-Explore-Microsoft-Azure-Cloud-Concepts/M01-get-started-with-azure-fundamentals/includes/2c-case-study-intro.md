## Case Study - Contoso, Ltd.

How using Azure and Cloud Computing can help with the Contoso and any of your projects.  Contoso, Ltd. is a company that carries a unique line of products and it growing rapidly.  They have moved from a local-startup business to nationwide in just a few years, and want to grow worldwide.  All of their current infrastructure is in on-premises data centers, and it growth has been a challenge.  The process of evaluating what hardware to buy, which projects and programs to invest money and data center resources into slows down the decision making, and the potential growth.  Contoso, Ltd. is looking to the cloud and Azure for some solutions.

Contoso's growth plans are massive project that will hopefully span much of the world not just in a few countries.  Additionally, growth is going to take infrastructure and the computers used potentially have a large capital expense cost, and variable usage.  Finally, Contoso knows from historical data that people adopt their products and services in waves, are there enough systems ready to take onboard the new customers; but not cost us money while we expand into each country.

These types of questions are common questions that Contoso, Ltd., and lets face it most companies, are faced with every day.  How do we make the best use of the dollars that we spend on computing hardware and software every day.
