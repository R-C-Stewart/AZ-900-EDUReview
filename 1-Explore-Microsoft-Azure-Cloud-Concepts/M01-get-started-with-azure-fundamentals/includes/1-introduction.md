## Welcome to Azure and cloud computing

As a technology professional, it would be nice to have servers, storage, databases, and other services immediately available when developing and deploying applications.  You should be able to click a button to start up a new server or add services to your solutions.  In your on-premises datacenter storing data, streaming video, or even hosting a website all require managing hardware and software.  Then don't forget the procurement process to buy new hardware, provisioning to install the software, and finally deploying it to your datacenter. This management is an unnecessary obstacle when delivering your application to your users. Luckily there is a solution to this problem: cloud computing.

Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals.  Azure services range from computers running in the cloud for you to run your software, to storage, to many other capabilities like Artificial Intelligence and IoT.  Join us on this journey as we take an entry level end-to-end look at Azure and it capabilities.  Additionally, as you learn about Azure you will also be preparing yourself for the Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) certification.
