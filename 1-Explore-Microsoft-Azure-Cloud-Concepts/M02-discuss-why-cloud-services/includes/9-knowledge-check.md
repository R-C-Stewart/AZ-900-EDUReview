## Multiple Choice
Which of the following terms describe a benefit of cloud services?
(x)Economies of scale{{That's correct. Economies of scale is the ability to do things more cheaply and more efficiently when operating at a larger scale in comparison to operating at a smaller scale.}}
()Fixed workloads{{That's incorrect.}}
()Unpredictable costs{{That's incorrect.}}

## Multiple Choice

Which of the following terms refer to spending money upfront and then deducting that expense over time?

(x) Capital expenditure{{That's correct. Capital expenditure refers to spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time.}}
() Operational expenditures{{That's incorrect.}}
() Supply and demand{{That's incorrect.}}

## Multiple Choice

Which of the following terms refer to making a service available with no downtime for an extended period of time?

() Agility{{That's incorrect.}}
() Fault tolerance{{That's incorrect.}}
(x) High availability{{That's correct. High availability keeps services up and running for long periods of time, with little downtime, depending on the service in question. }}

## Multiple Choice

Which term from the list below would be viewed as benefits of using cloud services?

() Unpredictable costs{{That's incorrect. Cloud computing typically has predictable 'pay-as-you-go' costing models.}}
() Local reach only{{That's incorrect. While you can isolate cloud resources and make them private, most of the time the services are public facing and reachable over the internet.}}
(x) Elasticity{{That's correct. Elasticity, agility and economies of scale are the correct answers, and would be seen as benefits that you can gain from using cloud services.}}

## Multiple Choice

Which term from the list below would be viewed as benefits of using cloud services?

(x)Elasticity {{That's correct. Elasticity (in addition to terms like agility and economies of scale) would be seen as benefits that you can gain from using cloud services.}}
()Un-predictable costs {{That's incorrect. Un-predictable costs and local reach only would not be benefits of using cloud services because cloud services do provide predictable costs and global reach.}}
()Local reach only {{That's incorrect. Un-predictable costs and local reach only would not be benefits of using cloud services because cloud services do provide predictable costs and global reach.
}}

## Multiple Choice

When looking at a cloud service, what expenditure type are cloud services based on?

()Capital Expenditure (CapEx) {{That's incorrect. Capital Expenditure (CapEx) is not the correct answer. Capital Expenditure (CapEx) is not required to be paid upfront when looking to start a cloud service. There are no up-front costs to use cloud services. You pay for what you consume, under a consumption-based model.}}
(x)Operational Expenditure (OpEx) {{That's correct. EOperational Expenditure (OpEx) is the correct answer. Cloud services operate on an Operational Expenditure model. It is regular, repeated expenditure that you pay for using cloud services.}}
()Friendly expenditure {{That's incorrect. Friendly expenditure and Maximum expense are not defined expenditure types.}}

## Multiple Choice

Which of the following terms relate to making a service available with no downtime for an extended period of time?

(x)High Availability {{That's correct. High Availability is the correct answer. The other answers, while they may be related, are not correct.}}
()Fault Tolerance {{That's incorrect. While falut tolerance may be related, it is not correct. Fault Tolerance is the ability to survive a failure of a component.}}
()Agility {{That's incorrect. While agility may be related, it is not correct. Agility is the ability to react quickly.}}

## Multiple Choice

From the choices below, what is one of the advantages of moving your infrastructure to Azure?

(x)The move reduces Capital Expenditures. (CapEx) {{That's correct. Public Cloud deployments reduce Capital Expenditures because there is far less infrastructure to buy; you effectively rent only what you use as you use it – CapEx is the best answer.}}
()The move reduces Operational Expenses (OpEx). {{That's incorrect. You will still have Operational Expenses, as you will still need to do certain parts of the work; the cost may be reduced from prior levels, but it will not be fully done away with.}}
()The move allows for complete control of infrastructure resources. {{That's incorrect. Because infrastructure resources are cloud-based and owned by the Cloud Service Provider, there is limited to no real control of those resources.}}

## Multiple Choice

Your company is considering a move to Azure across different regions as part of their requirements for their mission critical data and applications. They need to ensure as much “fast” access and uptime as available, and they are not expecting much change with respect to the demand of the resources. Which Azure features provide for this scenario?

(x)High Availability  {{That's correct. High Availability and Fault Tolerance meet the requirements for their mission critical data and applications, as well as meeting the uptime requirements.}}
()Elasticity {{That's incorrect. Elasticity isn't needed because the “demand of the resources” isn't expected to require much change. Elastic computing or cloud elasticity is the ability to quickly expand or decrease computer processing, memory, and storage resources to meet changing demands without worrying about capacity planning and engineering for peak usage.}}
()Economies of Scale {{That's incorrect. Economies of scale (cost) is not necessarily a factor.}}

## Multiple Choice

The ability of Azure to adjust workload resource support, meeting all peak demands without performance loss is an example of:

(x)Scalability {{That's correct. The ability of Azure to increase workload resource support meeting all peak demands without performance loss is an example of scalability.}}
()Agility {{That's incorrect. Agility is how quickly the change, up or down, can occur. }}
()Fault Tolerance {{That's incorrect. Fault Tolerance is how an application and / or data remains available after a partial loss of resources.}}
