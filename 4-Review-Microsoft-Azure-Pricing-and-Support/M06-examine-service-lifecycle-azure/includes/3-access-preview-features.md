## Preview - New Functionality/Features within an existing service

Some preview features relate to a specific area of an existing Azure Service. These preview features are accessible as you deploy, configure and manage the service. One such example is **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, where you can view preview functionality available within AKS by doing the following.


+ Sign into **Azure portal**
+ Open, **Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)** then click **Create Kubernetes service** button 
+ Under, **Cluster Details** > **Kubernetes version** section expand the drop-down list to display the versions.
+ The latest version **1.14.0** is listed as currently in preview **1.14.0 (preview)**. It's being made available to provide new functionality in AKS and allow testing.
