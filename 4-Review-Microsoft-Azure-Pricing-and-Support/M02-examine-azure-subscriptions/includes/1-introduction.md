## Introduction

From Enterprise Subscriptions to Free Trial Accounts to Pay-as-You-Go options you can buy Azure based on your company needs and business goals.  You can even have different subscriptions for different parts of your business.

Contoso Shipping is just getting started, so should start thinking early about how they want to subscribe to Azure.  Does the marketing team need their own subscription?  It would be great to give the development group a dev/test subscription to keep their choices in cloud components wide open, while limiting their costs.  Maybe we should set up centralized billing to track the over spend.

In this module we will discuss what types of offering are available, how you pay for them, and the best methods of choosing the right option your needs.
