Azure offers free and paid subscription options to suit different needs and requirements. 

+ **A free account**. Get started with 12 months of popular free services, $200 credit to explore any Azure service for 30 days, and 25+ services that are always free. Your Azure services are disabled when the trial ends or when your credit expires for paid products, unless you upgrade to a paid subscription.

+ **Pay-As-You-Go**. This subscription allows you to pay for what you use by attaching a credit or debit card to your account. Organizations can apply to Microsoft for invoicing privileges.

+ **Member offers**. Your existing membership to certain Microsoft products and services affords you credits for your Azure account and reduced rates on Azure services. For example, member offers are available to Microsoft Visual Studio subscribers, Microsoft Partner Network members, Microsoft BizSpark members, and Microsoft Imagine members.
