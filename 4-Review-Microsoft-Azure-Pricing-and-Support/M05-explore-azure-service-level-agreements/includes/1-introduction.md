## Introduction

Now that you are actively thinking of building solutions on Azure, how can you determine the reliability of the cloud services?  Is there a system in place to confirm your infrastructure is up and server customers? Ultimately you want to know that your solutions are active and available.  In your on-premises datacenter, you knew how reliable the hardware was.  And you exactly how long it would take to replace hardware if a problem occurred.  Let's take a look at Service Level Agreements (SLAs), to give you peace-of-mind.
